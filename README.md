# Personalized AI Motivation and Encouragement

Carol Tsao (cmt9839)

## What and Why?
I think having a personalized AI to send motivational messages to users would be an interesting project. This would ideally be an app that would take some information about the user so it can personalize messages. This can be to varying levels of personalization depending on the level of information provided by the user. So the app would periodically send the user messages in the form of notifications or when the user opens the app with motivational or comforting words. For instance, if the user tells the AI that today was a bad day, it might ask for some context and then provide some comfort or encouragement. 

This would help people perhaps feel a little less saddened, especially in today's society where keeping up with mental health goes a long way. A lot of people may not be able to talk to anyone about their problems or have anyone to comfort them when they really need it due to various circumstances, so these messages may make a difference. Although people may not find AI comfort to be as endearing as a human being, but sometimes, just hearing a few comforting words could lighten someone's mood.

## For Whom?
This can be for people of all ages, though primarily those who may be young and living alone, like college students or new grads, who are away from friends and family for an extended period of time that may want to hear some comforting words at times their family may be unavailable. In general, this may be useful to people who are struggling alone and need some comfort without the pressure of dumping your problems on your friends.

## How?

### Setup
Upon first downloading the app, it may ask some personal questions like age or gender, and potentially even take input on their day to day problems, though all of this would be optional with a note to inform users that the more information they give the app, the more personalized the messages. The information provided will be linked to an account for their app. 

### Home Screen and Chat
The home screen would ideally have a comforting, minimalistic aesthetic, with some of the most recent motivational or encourage messages, so that the user can see them when they first enter the app. Off to the bottom can be a chat icon that brings up the chat screen for users to communicate with the AI.

### The AI
Using the information given by the user on setup, the AI can try to tailor some messages to display on the homescreen. Susequent chats will enhance the knowledge of the user and allow the AI to tailor the messages more personally to the user. 

## Scope
I definitely think this is an ambitious project, but a basic model could be feasible. The level of personalization correlates to the learning model, so if the learning model and the data processing is simple then this could be feasible. Additionally, there would be some database management for the training data and user profiles. With a more minimal training set, this project can also be simplified, though that would again mean less personalization. This project is definitely on the difficult side, especially for those who may not know much about AI and learning models, but I think a basic model could be feasible but challenging.
